# Notes App Project - Scrimba Course

## First Challenge

1. Every time the `notes` array changes, save it
   in localStorage. You'll need to use JSON.stringify()
   to turn the array into a string to save in localStorage.

2. When the app first loads, initialize the notes state
   with the notes saved in localStorage. You'll need to
   use JSON.parse() to turn the stringified array back
   into a real JS array.

## Second Challenge

1. Lazily initialize our `notes` state so it doesn't
   reach into localStorage on every single re-render
   of the App component

> Result to complete on my own `Success 😀`
